#TicTacToe

Awesome TicTacToe!

##About this project

This project was implemented as a late term assignment in HUGB(Software engineering) in the University of Reykjavik. The main focus was not set on the implementation of the game itself but the infrastructure and best coding practices. 

##How to play

We did not break the traditional way to play tic tac toe. The player(s) is required to input the coordinates of the field to be filled with their respective symbol. This is done via input of two integers that correspond to the location of the field in the board (grid). These are integers between 1 and 3.
